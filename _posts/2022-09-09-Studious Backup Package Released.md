Is a small very simple library, that helps manage your project backups.

I wrote this because I was seeing so many people using sync services like OneDrive, to store their projects. The problem with this is that it doesn't work with Unity well.

Once the package has been installed, you have two options to make a backup, the first is from the tools menu along the top, and under Studious Backup, there is an option to run a backup.

The package is configurable, by going to the preferences section, by going to the Edit menu and selecting Preferences.
